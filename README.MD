# 📘 Terraform State Locking – Modern Overview (2025)

## 🧩 What is Terraform State?

Terraform tracks the real-world infrastructure it manages through a **state file** (`terraform.tfstate`). This file maps your `.tf` configuration to actual cloud resources.

## 🔒 What is State Locking?

**State locking** ensures that **only one Terraform operation (e.g., `apply`, `plan`, `destroy`) modifies the state file at a time**, preventing:
- Conflicts or overwrites from simultaneous runs
- State file corruption
- Inconsistent infrastructure deployments

## 🔁 Summary Flow of Terraform Locking

```
Start Terraform operation (e.g. apply)
        ↓
Attempt to acquire lock (DynamoDB or S3 .tflock)
        ↓
If lock acquired:
    Proceed with plan/apply
Else:
    Fail with lock error
        ↓
Update state file in S3
        ↓
Release lock (delete DynamoDB item or S3 .tflock)
```

## ⚙️ Locking Mechanism Options

### 🔵 Option 1: DynamoDB-Based Locking (Traditional)

#### ✅ How It Works
- Uses a **DynamoDB table** to track active locks.
- Requires manual setup of the table with correct schema (`LockID` as primary key).
- Locks are inserted before changes and deleted after.

#### ✅ Backend Example

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-lock-bucket303"
    key            = "dev/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
    encrypt        = true
  }
}
```

#### ✅ Pros
- Battle-tested and stable
- Works with all supported Terraform versions
- Supports visibility into locks via the AWS Console

#### ❌ Cons
- Requires managing an extra AWS resource (DynamoDB)
- Adds complexity and potential cost
- Possible stale locks requiring `terraform force-unlock`

### 🟢 Option 2: S3 Native Locking (`use_lockfile = true`) – ✅ **Recommended (2025+)**

#### ✅ Introduced in:
- **Terraform 1.10.0 (Nov 2024)** – Experimental
- **Terraform 1.11.0** – **Stable and Generally Available**

#### ✅ How It Works
- Uses **S3 conditional writes** to create a `.tflock` file next to the state file (e.g., `terraform.tfstate.tflock`)
- No need for DynamoDB at all

#### ✅ Backend Example

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-lock-bucket303"
    key            = "dev/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    use_lockfile   = true
    encrypt        = true
  }
}
```

#### ✅ Pros
- No DynamoDB needed
- Simpler configuration and maintenance
- Fast, cost-free locking via native S3 capabilities
- Now stable (as of Terraform 1.11.0)

#### ❌ Cons
- Requires **Terraform 1.11.0+**
- Less visible locking state (no table to inspect)
- Older automation or tools may expect DynamoDB-based logic

| Lock Storage              | DynamoDB `LockID`                 | `.tflock` object in S3               |
| Lock Visibility           | Viewable via DynamoDB Console     | Not visible in UI (S3 only)          |
| Ease of Setup             | Medium (need to create table)     | Very Easy (just toggle flag)         |
| Cost                      | S3 + DynamoDB read/write units    | S3 only (minimal)                    |
| Stale Lock Recovery       | Manual with `terraform force-unlock` | Automatic or via CLI              |
| Recommended for 2025+     | ❌ Legacy                         | ✅ Yes                                |

## 🛡️ Best Practices for Locking (Now and Future)

- ✅ Upgrade to **Terraform 1.11.0+**
- ✅ Use `use_lockfile = true` unless you need to support legacy pipelines
- ✅ Enable versioning on the S3 bucket to protect against accidental corruption
- ✅ Monitor `.tflock` files or automate cleanup via lifecycle rules if necessary
- ✅ Avoid running multiple `terraform` operations against the same state concurrently — even with locking

## 📂 Folder/File Clean-Up Reminder

After switching to S3 backend:
- Delete: `terraform.tfstate`, `.backup` files from local
- Keep: `.terraform.lock.hcl`, your `.tf` configs, `terraform.tfvars`

## ✅ Example: Updated S3 Backend with Native Locking

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "your-terraform-state-bucket"
    key            = "env/dev/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    encrypt        = true
    use_lockfile   = true
  }
}
```

> 🔒 Terraform will now use `.tflock` files for locking — no DynamoDB needed.
